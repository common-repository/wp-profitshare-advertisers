<strong>Product&Category page</strong>. Here we will add some profiling scripts who are used to profile your customers in order to send specific targeting ads.

<strong>Checkout page</strong>. In this page we are sending the orders to profitshare servers, the orders are sending by 2 methods, one by server and one by inserting iframe to checkout page.

<strong>Feeds</strong>. The products feed are generated by wordpress crons, daily, you can find your feed in wp-content\uploads\wp-profitshare-advertisers\. The crons are setup to work after you successfully complete your advertiser details in settings page, so, after that, you will have to wait some minutes to be able to see the products feed url in settings page.After that, you have to copy this link and insert it into your advertiser account (https://app.profitshare.ro/advertiser/account or https://profitshare.ro/advertiser/account - Settings tab).
